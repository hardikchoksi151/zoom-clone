# zoom-clone
A zoom-clone which implements the basic functionalities, It is made using webrtc, peerjs, socket.io and expressJS.

# How it works
- Clone repo, run npm i
- run npm start
- It is not hosted yet so cannot video-chat with other hosts because media acces is not given to sites which does not have SSL Encryption enabled.
- Just open localhost:3030, it will redirect you to a screen where you'll see your video, 
- copy the url and open it in another browser or on another tab
- Enjoy!
